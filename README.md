## Game Description
The chess game is a GUI-based game built using JavaFX and Scene Builder, and it features a menu that allows users to navigate to different pages. These pages include the home page, new game, scores, about the game, and contact us.

## How the Game works ‚ôüÔ∏è
* When the user selects the new game option from the menu, they are directed to a login page where they can enter their username and password to access the game. If the user is not registered, they can proceed to the register page to create an account.
* Once the user has logged in, they are directed to a page where they can choose the color and shape of the pieces they want to play with. They can also set the timer for the entire game, which starts when it's the player's turn and is paused when they move one of their pieces.
* The game begins when player select its pieces and set the timer. Players take turns making moves until one player checkmates the other or until the timer runs out. When the game ends, the scores of each player and the name of the winner are displayed on the scores page.
* The user is allowed to save the current state of the game to a file, which could then be loaded later to resume the game.
